                        Professional cosmetologists, aestheticians and nurses can always enhance their skills by
                        qualifying
                        for additional specialised courses.

                        Training with bea Skin Care provides the optimum learning experience, by working with
                        award-winning
                        skin care concepts and exploring up-to-date advanced practices. Offering chemical peels is a
                        natural
                        progression for your facial clientele. Chemical peels enhance the production of natural
                        collagen,
                        resulting in smooth, radiant, glowing skin and reduction of fine lines and scarring. This very
                        effective service is a must for any aesthetician in today’s competitive medical spa and skin
                        care
                        industry.

                        <br>
                        A chemical peel refers to the application of chemical solutions to smoothen the texture of skin
                        by
                        eliminating its damaged outer layers. Skin is likely to become uneven, scarred, spotted or
                        wrinkled
                        as a result of exposure to the sun, acne or just due ageing. Though generally used for face,
                        such
                        peels may be used for improving the skin of hands and necks.

                        You should understand that a chemical peel proves helpful for improving the look and feel of
                        skin

                    <p>
                        I’m Bianca Estelle, a Harley Street-trained Skin Specialist, Clinical Trainer, Director and IV
                        nutrient therapy practitioner.
                        <br><br>
                        My long years of experience in the aesthetics industry inspired me to create the bea Skin Care
                        brand of home-use and professional-only products, many of which include a variety of chemical
                        resurfacing agents.
                        <br><br>
                        I began my career in 2002, and since then, I’ve founded and managed three clinics in the UK,
                        establishing a loyal client base along the way. I personally treat hundreds of clients per year
                        and employ three aesthetic practitioners on a full-time basis at my Marylebone, Central London
                        clinic.
                        <br><br>
                        Our practice, bea Skin Clinic, specialises in the provision of chemical resurfacing agents;
                        thus, I am pleased to offer our first proprietary range of bea Skin Care Glycolic Peel
                        concentrations to selected medical practitioners and clinical practices.

                    <p>
                        I set out with the objective of developing clinical treatments and products that would
                        encourage consumers to understand their skin’s needs in a market that has, historically,
                        been dominated by traditional brands who sometimes misinterpret or entirely overlook their
                        needs.
                        <br><br>
                        The positive results I’ve observed, along with the success that the bea Skin Care brand has
                        enjoyed, encourage me to remain focused on providing an ever-expanding range of treatments
                        and products for all skin types. I’m deeply committed to sharing the knowledge I’ve gleaned
                        over the past 15 years, as well as discussing the latest innovative cosmeceutical techniques
                        with my fellow medical colleagues.

                        which is 100% natural, derived from sugar cane and carries advanced anti-ageing properties.

                            One of the best ways to acheive smoother, radiant skin is by having a chemical skin peel.
                            The
                            benefits of this treatment are immense, but it’s important to understand exactly what a
                            chemical
                            skin peel is and how it can help to improve your complexion.
                            <br><br>
                            It’s advisable to always start your peeling process on the mildest level and work your way
                            up so
                            that your skin has time to adjust to the higher concentrations of chemicals. Prior to your
                            peel
                            discuss your options with your doctor or skin specialist to be clear about what you’ll
                            experience and how long it will last. Clarify what potential results you can expect and how
                            much
                            social down time you should plan for.

                        </h3>
                        <p>• Glycolic acid is an AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) derived from sugar cane.<br>
                            • Glycolic acid is often used in cosmetic skin care products due to it small molecule size
                            which allows for easy penetration into the skin.<br>
                            • Glycolic acid works both on the dermis and epidermis.<br>
                            • Glycolic acid is an skin peeling agent.<br>
                            • Glycolic acid can provide gentle exfoliation which helps to slough off dulling dead cells
                            from the outermost layer of the skin that can contribute to clogged pores.</p>

                        <p>The treatment involves application of chemical solutions to the affected part of skin,
                            creating a controlled wound which also dissolves the top layer of skin cells, revealing
                            fresh and healthy new skin cells.

                            After its treatment the skin temporarily becomes more sensitive to the sun so it's vital to

                            action SPF and moisturiser that enhances protection against UVA and UVB rays.</p>

                            Effects of Glycolic Acid Peel treatment
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Glycolic acid peels are recommended to shrink pores and improve the overall look of skin on
                            your face and neck. Made up of a derivative of sugar cane, glycolic acid peels are a
                            medium-grade form of chemical peel, meaning that they target the epidermis of your skin
                            rather than penetrating down to the deeper layers. The peels are administered by a
                            dermatologist or skin specialist. When used properly, the positive results can last for
                            several months.
