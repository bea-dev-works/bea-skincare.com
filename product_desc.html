<p><span>Unique to bea Skin Care, these Vitamin Infused Konjac Sponges are fortified with a balancing and
        moisture-binding selection of Vitamins, including A, C, D, B1, B2, B12. This is in addition to each Konjac

<p>Each Vitamin Infused Konjac Sponge is immersed in saline, and later infused with the following ingredients:</p>
<p>VITAMIN A, C, D, B6, E, B2, B12, FOLIC ACID, COPPER.</p>


<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin A</span></h4>
<p>An essential nutrient that encourages new skin cell production. Stimulates fibroblasts responsible for developing new
    tissues, making the skin firmer and more elastic. Nourishes the skin, restoring its elasticity and youthful
    appearance.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin C</span></h4>
<p>Acts as an antioxidant and is the primary choice for lessening the effects of extrinsic skin ageing, lightening dark
    areas of discolouration that have arisen from UV damage. In its topical form, it fights free radicals and reverses
    oxidative damage to skin cells. It also boosts collagen levels, improving skin elasticity, and generates firmer and
    plumper skin.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin D</span></h4>
<p>An active form of calcitriol, vitamin D contributes to the growth and repair of skin cells. It also optimises the
    immune system to destroy free radicals that cause premature skin ageing.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin B6</span></h4>
<p>Reduces breakouts by protecting the skin against hormonal changes. Reduces the prevalence of dermatitis as well as
    redness, rashes, and itching. Rejuvenates the skin and imparts it with a natural glow.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin E</span></h4>
<p>Reduces the appearance of age spots and acne scars. Moisturises the skin, making it softer and more supple. Acts as
    an antioxidant that protects the skin against pollutants, harmful pathogens, and other toxic elements.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin B2</span></h4>
<p>An essential vitamin for breakout-prone skin. Regulates the secretion of sebum, hydrates dry skin, and reduces
    itching and redness. Clears up spots and revitalises the skin by enhancing cell turnover.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #444444;">Vitamin B12 (Cobalamine)</span></h4>
<p>A water-soluble vitamin that regulates the production of the pigment melanin in the skin, reducing dark spots,
    melasma, and pigmentation. Assists the body during the metabolism of proteins, which promote the growth of healthy
    skin cells and repair damaged tissue.</p>
